# 🛠 Package Management (Ubuntu/Debian)
# sudo stands for "superuser do" — it lets a normal user run commands as the root (admin) user.

sudo apt update                         # Check for available updates
sudo apt upgrade                        # Install updates for installed packages
sudo apt install packagename            # Install a new package (example: sudo apt install curl)

sudo cmd	                # Run just one command as root	Safer, limited privilege
sudo su               	    # Switch to full root shell	Admin wants full root access
