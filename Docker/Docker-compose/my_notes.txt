Docker networks 

✅ Why this works?
Docker network lets containers talk to each other by container name.
No need for IP addresses.
Fully isolated from your host machine.
👉 This is how microservices usually work inside Docker.


docker network create my-network    - Create a virtual network my-network so Docker containers can talk to each other by name.
e.g.
docker network create mongo-network
