🔑 How Juspay Test Mode Works

Create a merchant account on Juspay Dashboard # https://juspay.io/contact?country=IN
.

They give you:

Test API Key

Test Merchant ID

Use sandbox APIs to create orders and process payments.

Juspay provides test card numbers & UPI IDs to simulate:

Successful payment

Failed payment

Pending payment

⚙️ Integration Flow (Dummy Mode)

Generate an Order ID in your backend (with amount & customer details).

Call Juspay API to initialize payment:

Endpoint: /txns (in sandbox mode).

Pass your test merchant ID + order details.

Juspay returns a payment session/token.

Load Juspay Checkout (UI) on frontend with that token.

Use test cards/UPI → Juspay will simulate success/failure.

Handle callback/webhook from Juspay → update your DB (e.g., mark order as paid).

Example (Pseudo-code)

Backend:

import requests

url = "https://sandbox.juspay.in/txns"

headers = {
  "Authorization": "Basic your_test_api_key",
  "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
}

data = {
  "order_id": "order_12345",
  "amount": "500.00",
  "currency": "INR",
  "customer_id": "cust_001",
  "return_url": "http://localhost:3000/payment_status"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
print(response.json())   # contains payment link / token
